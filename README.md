# G WIKI

It's a SAAS that allows users to create public and private Markdown-based wikis.

It was developed during my 2nd month of apprenticeship at [Bloc.io](http://bloc.io)

## Setup

Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.
